# gitwatch

GitHub webhook to notify people (currently by HipChat only) when someone touches certain paths in a repo.

Useful e.g. for [CSS gatekeepers](http://www.slideshare.net/Codemotion/ui-realigning-refactoring-by-jina-bolton).

Also interesting as a social experiment: does this exacerbate or highlight problems of code ownership?

Current status: spike. Use at your own peril.
